# In programming languages, the boolean, or logical, type is a common way to represent something that has only two opposite states.
is_sth = True
if_sth = False

# There are three built-in boolean operators in Python: and, or and not.
# And:
a = True and True    # True 
b = True and False   # False
c = False and False  # False
d = False and True   # False

#Or
a = True or True    # True
b = True or False   # True
c = False or False  # False
d = False or True   # True

#Not
to_be = True           # to_be is True
not_to_be = not to_be  # not_to_be is False
