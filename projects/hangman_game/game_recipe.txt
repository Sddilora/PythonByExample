Let's take a brief look at what you are going to build in this project. Here is what the gameplay will look like:

- In the main menu, players can choose to either play or exit the game;
- If players choose to play, the computer picks a word from a list — it will be the answer;
- The computer asks players to enter a letter that may or may not be in the word;
- If players suggest a letter that does not appear in the word for the first time, It's a miss. A player can miss 8 times before the game is over;
- If the letter does occur in the word, the computer notifies the players. If there are letters left to guess, the computer invites the player to go on;
- When the entire word is uncovered — it's a victory! The game should calculate the final score and return to the main menu.
